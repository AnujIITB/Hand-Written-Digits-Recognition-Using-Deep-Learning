# Hand-Written-Digits-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning

## Problem Statement:

The problem statement is to classify handwritten digits. The goal is to take an image of a handwritten digit and determine what that digit is. The digits range from zero (0) through nine (9).

## Dataset Used:

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. 
The dataset chosen here contains 42000 samples. 

## Metrics:

We will use the accuracy score to quantify the performance of our model. The accuracy will tell us what percentage of our test data was classified correctly. The accuracy is a good metric choice because it will be easy to compare our modelâ€™s performance to that of the benchmark as it uses the same metric.
1. Built a Neural Network to recognise hand written digits on MNIST dataset from Scratch
2. Applied different Activation Function and loss function like MSE and Cross Entropy for comparing results
3. Implemented Weight Initialisation, Regularisation and Dropout and achieved an Accuracy of 97%
